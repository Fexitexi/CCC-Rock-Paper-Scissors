# Java Input Reader

### Description
This repository contains an input reader implemented in java that can read from files or
folders (ie all files inside a folder). The main purpose of this project is to take over
tedious Input- and Output Management in Coding competitions. This repository can be used 
as a template to build your solution on.  
Made by **Philippe Zorman**

### Usage
**IOManager.java:** This class takes over the required logic and error handling for inputs and outpus, it should not be changed.  
**Main.java:** This class serves as the interface for the user to implement their code. The code of all methods can be changed, unless comments say otherwise.
**void Main.solve():** This is the function where the code for the required algorithm belongs.
