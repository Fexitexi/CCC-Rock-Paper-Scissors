# Java Input Reader

### Description
This repository contains an input reader implemented in java that can read from files or
folders (ie all files inside a folder). The main purpose of this project is to take over
tedious Input- and Output Management in Coding competitions. This repository can be used 
as a template to build your solution on.

### Usage
IOManager.java takes over the required logic and error handling, it should not be changed. 
The code of all methods in Main.java can and should be changed, unless comments say otherwise.

### TODO
- [ ] Support for recursive folder search (just one level at the moment)  
- [ ] Support for specification of file types or names to be used or ignored as input  
- [ ] A Debugger to prettify debug output and show more information with specific data types  
reverse engineering?
